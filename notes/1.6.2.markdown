## interpolation

- Added new #between API to Query DSL

This was the only API to use between in Query DSL.

    select.from(User as u).where.column(u.id).between(101, 200)

The above #between is deprecated since 1.6.2, and the following API is added and recommended.

    select.from(User as u).where.between(u.id, 101, 200) 

- Added #append to all the SQLBuilder

So far, there was no other way even if you needed to use unsupported SQL syntax in Query DSL. 

So #append(SQLSytnax) is added to all the SQLBuilder.


## library

- #133 Logging of SQLException should be configurable

Thanks to @rvangsgaard's feedback:

    GlobalSettings.loggingSQLErrors = false

- #134 Adding ConnectionPoolSettings.connectionTimeoutMillis

Thanks to @landtuna's feedback:

    new ConnectionPoolSettings(connectionTimeoutMillis = 1000L)

- Improved error messages for ResultSetExtractorException


Enjoy writing typesafe SQL and get things done!
