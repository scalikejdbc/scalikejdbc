### Topics

#### Support only Scala 2.10 and 2.11

Finally Scala 2.9.x (and Play 2.0.x) is dropped in version 2.0.x.

mapper-generator (sbt plugin) for sbt 0.12.x is already dropped.

#### Renamed joda-time APIs due to JSR-310

UnixTimeInMillisConverter#toDateTime is renamed to #toJodaDateTime (#toLocalDate, #toLocalTime, #toLocalDateTime too)

WrappedResultSet#dateTime, #localDate, #localTime and #localDateTime are deprecated and #jodaDateTime and #jodaXXX are added.

#### Modules structure improvements

Now "org.scalikejdbc" %% "scalikejdbc" includes SQL interpolation feature. 

`import SQLInterpolation._` no longer required. Just `import scalikejdbc._` works fine.

#### Separated Play2 support into another project

Versioning policy will follow Play's versions. 

(e.g.) 2.2.x for Play 2.2.x, 2.3.x for Play 2.3.x
