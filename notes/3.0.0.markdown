ScalikeJDBC 3.0.0 is out for Scala 2.12, 2.11 and 2.10 with new useful features including the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) support module!

### Topics

#### Support Scala 2.12/2.11/2.10 on JDK 8

ScalikeJDBC 3.0 requires Java SE 8 or higher. All libraries are built against Scala 2.12, 2.11 and 2.10.

#### Merging JSR-310 module into core module

Since scalikejdbc-core 3.0 can depend on JDK 8 APIs, we merged scalikejdbc-jsr310 module into scalikejdbc-core module.
If you're already using time APIs, You don't need add scalikejdbc-jsr310 to your libraryDependencies anymore.

In the migration, there is no source code incompatibility to existing applications.

#### Reactive Streams support

Newly arrived module, scalikejdbc-streams, is an extension to support [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) to subscribe results from database queries.

https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc/tree/master/scalikejdbc-streams

[scalikejdbc-streams](https://github.com/scalikejdbc/scalikejdbc/tree/master/scalikejdbc-streams) is a Reactive Streams 1.0 compliant implementation.
We never release without passing the existing unit tests to satisfy [PublisherVerification](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/v1.0.0/tck#structure-of-the-tck) in [Reactive Streams TCK](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/v1.0.0/tck).

This library is originally assumed to be suitable for batch applications. You need to keep borrowing a connection while someone is subscribing a stream provided by scalikejdbc-streams.
Be aware of the max size of connection pool and carefully monitor the state of the pool.

```
import scalikejdbc._
import scalikejdbc.streams._
import java.util.concurrent._
import org.reactivestreams.example.unicast.AsyncSubscriber

// Prepare a connection pool in advance.
Class.forName("org.h2.Driver")
ConnectionPool.singleton("jdbc:h2:file:./db/hello", "user", "pass")

// ------------
// publisher
val publisherExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)
implicit val publisherEC = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(publisherExecutor)
val publisher: DatabasePublisher[Int] = DB readOnlyStream {
  sql"select id from users".map(r => r.int("id")).iterator
}

// ------------
// subscriber
val subscriberExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)
val subscriber = new AsyncSubscriber[Int](subscriberExecutor) {
  override def whenNext(element: Int): Boolean = { 
    // do something here
    log.info(s"element: ${element}")
    true 
  }
  override def whenComplete(): Unit = {
    if (executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS) == false) {
      log.warn("Timed out while waiting for all tasks terminated")
    }
    subscriberExecutor.shutdownNow()
  }
}
publisher.subscribe(subscriber)
```
