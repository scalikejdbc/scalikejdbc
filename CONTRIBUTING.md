## ScalikeJDBC Contributors' Guide

### Issues

- Questions should be posted to the [ScalikeJDBC Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalikejdbc-users-group)
- Please describe your issue in detail (version, situation, examples)
- We may close your issue if we have no plan to take action on it. We appreciate your understanding.

### Pull Requests

- Pull requests should be sent to the "master" branch
- Source and binary compatibility must always be kept
- scalafmt must be applied to all Scala source code
- Prefer creating separate Scala source files for each class/object/trait (except, of course, for sealed traits)
- The ScalikeJDBC build checks for binary compatibility using the [mima](https://github.com/lightbend/mima). After a 2.x.0 release, binary compatibility must be maintained for subsequent 2.x series releases.

#### Testing your pull request

All pull requests should pass the CI jobs before they can be merged:

Testing with default settings is required when pushing changes:

```sh
sbt library/test
sbt interpolation/test
```

If your change needs testing with MySQL/PostgreSQL:

```sh
./scripts/run_tests.sh mysql
./scripts/run_tests.sh postgresql
```
